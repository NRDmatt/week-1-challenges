   ## Redacting and revising Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc website code.
* For this challenge I reviewed Horiseon HTML and CSS code and made changes to the files to make the code more accessbile.
## Problems 
* I found that on the index.html file there was non-semantic code, mostly pertaining to a excess use of .div which gave no explantion of its content.

* On the #style .css file there was a unnecessary amount of code  pertaining the same instructions for different website attributes.

* The link for class="search-engine-optimization" was not working properly on the website userface.
## Solutions

* To make the index.html file more semantic I added /sections and /classes to better illustrate the content in the css code.

* To clean up the #style.css file I grouped the code together that pertained the same information into one line of code to make the code more compact and visually appealing.  

* To make the link work properly on the websites interface, I first checked the differences of the code in the index.html file and noticed that the class="search-engine-optimization" did not have a ID assigned with it while the other links did. I assigned a ID to the link and it fixed the issue.
